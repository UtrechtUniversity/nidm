<h2>Part 2</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In part 2 of the experiment, you participate in two games. In each game, 
    you are one person in a network of 60 participants. You are  displayed 
    as a square on your  own screen. All other participants are shown as 
    circles. We call your square and the circles of other participants  
    “nodes”. Relations between participants are indicated as lines between 
    the nodes. Each game consists of about 15 to 20 rounds. Before round 
    1, a starting network is generated on the screen and one participant 
    in the network will be infected with a (hypothetical) disease. The 
    node of this participant will be colored red. Nodes that have relations 
    with an infected (red) node can also get infected in subsequent rounds.
</p>

<h3>Game rounds</h3>

<p>Each game consists of about 15 to 20 rounds. Each round consists of 
    4 stages.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> In this stage, nodes can get infected. In 
    the first round, only one node is infected. In all other rounds, other 
    nodes can get infected. The probability of getting infected depends on 
    the number of red nodes with whom you are connected. If you are not 
    connected with a red node, you cannot get infected. If you are 
    connected to  1 red node, the probability of infection is 0.15 and 
    increases for each additional infected node (see below). </p>

<table id="infections"><thead>
<tr>
<th>infectious neighbors</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>1</th>
<th>2</th>
<th>3</th>
<th>4</th>
<th>5</th>
<th>6</th>
<th>7</th>
<th>8</th>
<th>9</th>
<th>10</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>chance of getting infected</td>
<td>0.00</td>
<td>0.15</td>
<td>0.28</td>
<td>0.39</td>
<td>0.48</td>

<td>0.62</td>

<td>0.80</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

<p>If you get infected, your node will also turn red, and you will stay 
    infected for <strong>exactly 4 rounds</strong>. After these four 
    rounds, your node will turn green, you will get immune, and you 
    cannot get the disease anymore in this game. All other immune nodes 
    will also be colored green.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> In stage 2, you can break relations or 
    propose new relations in the network. There will be 12 nodes 
    displayed on the right side of the screen, for which you can 
    either choose to break the relation or to propose a new relation. 
    The buttons to make the decisions are also colored (red if that 
    node is infected with the disease, green if that node is immune 
    and gray otherwise). Breaking relations you can decide yourself, 
    but before you can establish a new relation, the other participant 
    needs to agree on this relationship as well. You will have exactly 
    60 seconds to make your decisions in this stage in each round. 
    After that, the game proceeds automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> In stage 3, you can indicate which relations 
    that others have proposed to you, you indeed also would like to have. 
    These are again displayed on the right side of the screen and colored 
    as explained before. Other participants will simultaneously decide 
    whether to accept your proposals.
</p>

<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> In stage 4, your points for this round are 
    calculated (see next section).</p>

<p>Note that stages 1 (disease transmission) and 4 (points computation) 
    are done by the system and the outcomes will be presented as information 
    on the screen (color of nodes, number of points). So in practice, you 
    will move back and forth between stages 2 (breaking / proposing 
    relations) and 3 (accepting proposed relations).</p>

<h3>Earning points</h3>

<p>How many points you earn depends on three things:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Your relations:</strong> If you have 0 relations, you earn 
    0 points. The first relation earns you quite some points, the second 
    a bit less, and so on until you can earn maximally 100 points for 6 
    relations. If you have more than 6 relations, the number of points 
    you earn will decrease again.

    <table id="infections"><thead>
        <tr>
        <th>number of relations</th>
        <th>0</th>
        <th>1</th>
        <th>2</th>
        <th>3</th>
        <th>4</th>
        <th>5</th>
        <th>6</th>
        <th>7</th>
        <th>8</th>
        <th>9</th>
        <th>10</th>
        <th>11</th>
        <th>12</th>
        <th>13</th>
        <th>..</th>
        </tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr>
        <td>points earned per round</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>31</td>
        <td>56</td>
        <td>75</td>
        <td>89</td>

</li>

<li><strong>Relations between nodes connected to you:</strong> The two 
    games you play will differ in how many points you earn based on the 
    relations between your connections. The game you are playing will 
    be indicated on the screen.
<ul>
<li><strong>Game A</strong> - You will be awarded 21 additional points if 
    there are no relations between any of the nodes you are connected to. 
    For each relation between these nodes, you will lose some of these 21 
    points. </li>
<li><strong>Game B</strong> - You will be awarded 21 additional points 
    if you are connected to 5 other nodes that all have relations among 
    each other as well, while you have one relation to another node not 
    in this group. If your connections have fewer relations among each 
    other, you lose some of these 21 points.</li>
